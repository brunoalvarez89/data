CD8+ clones were generated after repeated in vitro stimulation with autologous irradiated infected PBMC. Prior to the third stimulation, cell lines were depleted of CD4+ T cells and gammadelta T cells by Ab and complement-mediated lysis. Clones were generated from the CD8+ T cell-enriched cell lines by limiting dilution 7 d after the third stimulation.","Tables I and IV.","in vitro assay","cytotoxicity","","Positive","","","2","2","100","Blood","T cell CD8+","Cell Line / Clone","","","Blood","PBMC","Direct Ex Vivo","BoLA-2*012:01","I","MHC binding assay","Epitope","Linear peptide","KSSHGMGKVGK","49","59","","hypothetical protein TP01_0056","tr|Q4N9Q8|Q4N9Q8_THEPA CD8+ T cell target antigen Tp2 OS=Theileria parva OX=5875 GN=TP01_0056 PE=4 SV=1","Q4N9Q8","Theileria parva strain Muguga","Theileria parva","5875","Epitope specific cell clones were obtained from two animals either post inmunization or challenge with Theileria parva. Between 60% and 80% of the obtained CD8+ clones recognized PBMC T. annulata- infected cells pulsed with epitope peptide in a standard 4-h [111In]-release cytotoxicity assay. The analysis of fine specificity of the different clones using single residue alanine mutant peptides showed that had the clones had divergent fine specificities manifest as differences in recognition of the mutant peptides with alanine at P1, P4, P5, P7, P9, and P10 residues. All the clones reacted to peptides mutated in P2 and P3. Strikingly, all the clones were unable to recognize the peptide mutated at position P8. This pattern is maintained in polyclonal cell lines from the immunized animals."
